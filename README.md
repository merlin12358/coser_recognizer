# coser_recognizer
先开个坑，目标是打开实现拍coser，可以识别coser的人物与出处
# a dataset of anime character images
# a Python script that can identify the characters and origins of cosplay based on the captured coser images
# package this script into an Android program, and this program can open the camera to take photos, and the captured photos can be directly analyzed by the script
